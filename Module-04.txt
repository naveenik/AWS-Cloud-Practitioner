Modules:
1. Security and Compilance
2. Account Managment, Billing and Support
3. Advanced Identity
4. Other Services
5. AWS Well Architected Framework

1. --------  Security and Compliance  -------- 

a. AWS Responsibility - Security of the Cloud
Protecting Infrastructure(hardware, software, facilities and networking) that runs all the aws services
Managed services like S3, Dynamo DB, RDS etc

b. Customer Responsibility
For EC2 Instance, customer is responsible for management of the guest OS(inlcuding securiity patches and updates)
firewall and network configuration

DDOS protection on AWS (Distributed Denial of service) - DDOS
* AWS Shield Standard: Protect against DDOS attack for your website and applications, for all customers at no addditional costs
* AWS Shield Advanced: 24/7 Premium DDos Protection
* AWS WAF: Filter specific requests based on rules
* CloudFront and Route53: Combined with AWS Shield, provides attack mitigation at the edge

AWS Shield: 
* Free service that is activated for every AWS customer
* Provides protection from attacks layer3/layer4, UDP, Reflection attacks

AWS Shield Advanced:
* Optional DDos mitigation service($3000 per month)
* Protect against more sophosticated attack on EC2, ELB, DB ans other Importand Core service
* 24/7 access to AWS DDos response team

AWS WAF - Web Application Firewall
* Protects youe web applications from common web exploits
* Layer 7 is HTTP(vs layer 4 is TCP)
* Define Web Access control list(WACL)
  Rules can include IP address and HTTP headers and body
  protects from common attaks SQL Injection and cross site scripting
  size constraints and geo-match
  
Peneteration Testing:
AWS Customers are welcome to carry out security assesments or peneteration tests,
against their AWS Infrastructure without prior approval for below services.

* Amazon EC2 Istances, NAT, Gateways and ELB
* RDS
* Cloudfront
* Aurora
* API Gateways
* lambda
* Lighsail resources
* Elastic Beanstalk Enviornments
***
Prohibites like DDOS, port and protocol Flooding

----- Encryption -------

a) AWS KMS(Key Management Service):
encryption for an AWS service, its most likely KMS
Encryption Opt-In:
* EBS volumes, S3, Redshift, RDS, EFS Drives are encrypted through Opting method

Encryption Automatically Enabled:
Cloud Trial Logs, S3 Glacier.

b) Cloud HSM(Hardware security Module):
KMS ==> AWS manages the software for Encryption
Cloud HSM ==> AWS provides Encyption Hardware
You manage your own Encryption keys entirely(not AWS)
***
Types of Customer Master Keys: CMK
* Customer Managed CMK
* AWS managed CMK
* AWS owned CMK
* CloudHSM Keys

-------- Amazom Certificate Manager (ACM) ---------
HTTP - No Encryption between requests and response
HTTPS -  requests and response are encrypted using TLS/SSL
Its Provision, manage and deploy SSL/TLS certificates
Its used to provide in-flight Encryption for webbsites(HTTPS)
Integrations with (load TLS certificates on)
* Elastic Load Balancer
* CloudFront Distributions
* APIs on API Gateway
****
AWS Secrets Manager for Integration with RDS mostly(Mysql, PostgresSQl, Aurora)
Its for storing secrets

--------- AWS Artifact ---------
Portal that provides customers with on-demand access to AWS Compliance documentation and AWS agreements
Artifact Reports and Artifact Agreements - can be used in support internal audit or compliance

--------- Amazon GuardDuty -------

Intelligent Threat Discovery to Protect AWS account
Uses Machine learning algorithms, anomaly detection, 3rd party data

Inputs: CloudTrail Logs, VPC Flow Logs, DNS Flow logs etc

Inputs --> Amazon Guard ---> Cloudwatch Event ---> SNS (send notifications)

--------- Amazon Inspector ----------
Automated Security Assesments for EC2 Instances
It Analyze the running OS against Known Vulnerabilities

AWS Inspector agent must be installed on OS in EC2 instanaces

-------- Amazon Config Overview -------
Helps with auditing and recording compliance of your AWS resources
Helps record configurations and changes over time
Questions that can 	be solved by AWS Config?
* Is there Unrestricted SSH access to my security groups?
* Do my Buckets have any Public access?
* How has my ALB configuration changed over time?

-------- Amazon Macie Overview ------- 

Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses
machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive data in AWS

-------- Amazon Security Hub -------

Central security Tool to manage security across several AWS accounts and automate security checks
Autoamtically aggregates alerts in predefined or personal findings from various AWS services 
GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie, IAM Access layer, AWS system Manager, Firewall Manager, Partner Netwrok solutions
Must first enable the AWS Config Cache

------- Amazon Detective --------

It Analyzes, investigates and quickly identifies the root cause if security issues or suspicious activities (Using ML Scripts and graphs)
Automatically collects and process events from VPC Flow logs, CloudTrial, GuardDuty and Create a unified View
Produce visualizations with details and context to get to the root cause

------- Amazon Abuse ------
Reported suspected AWS resources used for abusive or illegal purposes
Ex: Spam mails, Port scanning, Ddos, Intusion attempts, Hosting Ojectionable, Distrubuting malware

------- Root User Privilages ------

Root user = Account owner(when account created)
Has complete access to all AWS services and resources
Lock away your AWS account root user access keys!
Do not use root account for everyday tasks, even administrative tasks
Actions that can be performed only by root user:
* Change accout settings
* View certain Tax invoices
* Close your AWS account
* Restore IAM user permissions

2. ------------ Account Managment, Billing and Support  ----------------

AWS Organizations: Allows to manage multiple AWS accounts
Main acccount  is master account
***
Restrict account privileges using Service Control Policies

Multi Account Strategies: Create account per department, per team or 
cost centre based on regulatory restrictions using SCP or Seperate VPC.
* Multi Account vs Sigle Account with Multi VPC
* Use tagging standard for Billing purposes
* Enable CloudTrial on all accounts, send logs to central S3 account
* Send CloudWatch logs to central logging account

Service Control Policies:
* Whitelist or Blacklist IAM actions
* Applied at OU or account level
* Does not Appply to the master account
* SCP is applied to all the Users and Roles of the account, including Root.
* The SCP does not affect services-linked Roles
* SCP must have an explicit Allow
ex: Restrict access to certain services( can't use EMR)
