Modules:
1. Types of Cloud Computing
2. IAM
3. Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2)
4. EC2 Instance Storage
5. ELB and ASG

1. --------  Types of Cloud Computing   -------- 

1. Infrastructure as a service
Provide the Building block for CLoud IT

ex : EC2

2. Platform as a Service
Removes the need for your organization to manage the undelying Infrastructure
ex : Elastic Beanstalk
Heroku, Google App Enginer

3. Software as a service
Completed product that is run and managed bu the service provider
ex : Google apps Gmail, DropBox , Zoom

Pricing for Compute 
Compute : Pay for compute time
Storage : Pay for data stored in Cloud
Data Transfer : Pay for OUT of the cloud , Free for IN data transfer

  -----      AWS regions ----
AWS has regions all around the world
names can be eu-west-1, eu-west-2 , eu-central-1 etc

Region is a cluster fo Data centres 
1. Each region has many availabilty Zones
   eu-west-1a, eu-west-1b, eu-west-1c
2. Each availability Zone is one or more descrete data centres with redundant power, networking and connectivity
3. They are seperated frome each others, so that they are isolate from disasters.
4. They are connected with high-bandwidth, Ultra-low latency networking 

2. --------  IAM   --------

IAM is a global service.
who can securely manage and acces to AWS service and resources
Using IAM create user and groups and manage their access to means of permsission AWS resource ALLOW or deny
To keep secure IAM:
Rotate credentials regularly
Configure a strong password policy for users
Enable MFA

IAM policies: It define permissions for an action regardless of the method that you use to perform the Operation.
IAM roles: To grant permission within aws services
we commomly use the EC2 and lambda services for IAM roles

---- IAM Guidelines  and Best practises ----
. Dont use the root account except for AWS account setup
. one physical user = One AWS user
. Assign users to group and  assign permissions to groups
. create a strong password policy
. use and enforce the use of Multi factor Authentication
. create and use roles for giving permissions to AWS services
. Use Access keys for Programatic access(CLI )

--------- Summary --------------
Users: Mapped to a physical user, has a password for AWS Console
Groups: contians users only
Policies: JSON documents that outlines permissions for users and groups
Roles: For EC2 Instance or AWS Services
Security: MFA + Password Policy
AWS CLI: manage your AWS services using the command line
AWS SDK: manage your AWS services using the programming language
Access keys: access AWS using CLI or SDK
Audit: IAM Credential Reprots & IAM Access advisor

3. ---- Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2) -------

Infrastructure as a service, It mainly consists in the capacity of:
1. Renting virtual Machines(EC2)
2. Storing Data on virtual drives(EBS)
3. Distributing load across machines(ELB)
4. Scaling the services using an auto scaling group(ASG)

EC2 sizing and configurations options
1. Operating systesm: Linux, Windows or Mac OS
2. How much compute power and cores(CPU)
3. How much random-acess memmory(RAM)
4. How much storage space
   Network attached (EBS and EFS)
   Hardware attached (EC2 instance store)
5. Netwrok card: Speed of the card, Public IP address
6. Firewall rules: Security Group
7. Bootstrap script( configure at first launch ): EC2 user data

Bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
That script is only run once at the instance first starts
. Installing Updates
. Installing Software
. Downloading common files from the internet

The EC2 user Data script runs with the root user

----   ec2-user data ----
#!/bin/bash
#use this for user data (from top to bottom)
#install httpd
yum install -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)<h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html


EC2 Instance types 
. Genereal purpose : Great for a diversity of workload such as web serviers or code repositories (T and M series)
. Compute Optimized : Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performace processors Ex : Machine learning, AI tasks (C series)
. Memory Optimized : Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets  Ex: Relational and Non - relaional DB (R and X series)
. Storage Optimized : Great for Storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
 
Security Groups:
. Security Groups are acting as a firewall on EC2 instance
. They regulate
Acces to ports
Authorised IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6
Control of inbound networking
Control of Outbound networking

Good to Know about the Security Groups
. Can be attached to multiple instances
. Locked down to a region VPC combination
. Its good to maintain one seperate secuiry groups for SSH access
. All inbound traffic is Blocked by default
. All outboubd traffic is Authorised by default

*** 
If your Application is not accessible(Time out), then its a security group issue
If your Application gives a "Connection refused" error, then its a Application error or its not launched.

Classic ports to know
22 = SSH - login into a linux
3389 = RDP - login into a windows instance
80 = HTTP - acccess unsecured websites
443 = HTTPS - access to secured websites

EC2 Instance Types
1. On-Demand: Short workload, predictable pricing
2. Reserved:(Minimun 1 year)
3. Spot Instances: Short workloads, cheap , can lose instances(less reliable)
4. Dedicated Hosts: Book an Entire physical server, control instance Placement

----------- Summary ---------------

EC2 Instance: AMI + Instance size(CPU + RAM) + storage + security groups + Ec2 user data
Security Groups: Firewall attached to the EC2 Instance
EC2 user data: Script launched at the first start of an instance
SSH: start a terminal into our EC2 Instances
EC2 Instance Role: Link to IAM Roles
Purchasing Options: On-Demand, spot, Reserved, Dedicated host and dedicated Instance

4. ------ EBS Volume(Ec2 Instance storage) ---------

An EBS (Elastic Block store)Volume is a networkdrive you can attach to your instance while they run.
It allows your instances to persist data, even after their terminiation
They can only be mounted to one instance at a time
They are bound to specific availablity zone

General Purpose SSD: Recommended for most workloads, can be used as boot volumes, best for development and test systems
Provisioned IOPS SSD: Meant for business critical applications that require sustained IOPS, best suited for larger DB workloads
Throughput Optimized HDD: straming workloads, fast throughput at low price, big data warehouses and log processing, cannot be boot volume
Cold HDD: Orient storage for Large volumes that is infrequently accessed, scenario where lowst cost storage is important, cannot be boot volume


Its a network drive: It uses network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
An EBS volume in us-east-1a cannot be attached to us-east-1b
To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it.

EBS snapshots:
1. Not neccessary to detach volume to so snapshot, but recommended
2. Can copy snapshots across AZ or Regions
3. Snapshot are created and copied to required region and we can use it as Normal EBS volume for Operations

AMI Overview:
Amazon Machine Image are a customize of an EC2 instance
You can add your own software, configuration, operating systems, montoring
AMI are built for specific region( and can be copeied across regions)

EC2 Instance Store: It has better IO performance, but data is lost if the EC2 Instance is stopped or
                    terminated or when the underlying disk drive fails.
EC2 Image builder: 
It Simplifies the building, testing and deployment of virtual machine and container images for use on AWS or  on-premises
Image Builder Dispatches the work to be performed by copying the document and application to your instance

EFS- Elastic File system
. Managed NFS(network file system) that can be mounted to 100s of Ec2
. EFS only work with Linux EC2 with Multi AZ
. Highly avaialbel, scalable, Expensive, no capacity planning(charges)

Amazon SFX: for windows file server provides fully managed, highly reliable and 
scalable file storage that is accessible over the Standard server message Block

5. --------- ELB and ASG -----------

Scalability means that an application can handle greater loads by adapting (Two kinds of Scalability)
1. Vertical
2. Horizontal

Vertical Scalability means increasing the size of the instance
ex: application scaling from t2.micro to t2.large 
Scale up means incresing size, Scale down means decreasing size
Its very common for non disrubuted systems, such as databases also hardware limit

Horizontal Scaling means increasing the number of instances for your application
Horizontal scaling implies distibuted systems
Scale out increase the number of instances
Scale in decrease the number of instances
This is very common for web application/ Modern applications

High Availabity - 
Usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling
High Availabity means running your application in atleast 2 Availabity Zones
The goal of High Availabity is to survive data centre loss
We use Auto scaling Group and load balancer for this

High Availabity: Run instances for the same application across multi AZ 
. Auto scaling with mutli AZ
. Load Balancer with multi AZ

Scalabity: Ability to accommodate a larger load by making the hardware stronger(scale up) or by adding the nodes(scale out)
Elasticity: Once system is scalable, elasticity means that there will be some "auto-scaling" so that the system can scale based on the load.
Agility(not related to scalability): New resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make,
those resources available to your developers from week to just minutes.

Load Balancing:
Load Balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers(EC2 Instances) Downstream

Why LB:
Spread load across multiple downstream instances
Expose a Single point of access(DNS) to your application
Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instaces
High available across zones

Elastic Load Balancer is a managed load balance(AWS take care of Integration, maintenance and Upgradation and uptime)
It forwards the request to Ec2 Instances, containers, IP address and Lambda funcrions.

3 Kinds of Load balancer offered by AWS
* Application Load Balancer(HTTP/HTTPS) - Layer 7 (path based routing, host based, websockets, containerized)
* Network Load Balancer(ultra-high performace, allows for TCP) - Layer 4 (It wont supportpath or host)
* Classic Load Balancer (Slowly retaining) - Layer 4 and 7 - Old generation method (It wont supportpath or host)

Auto Scaling Group:
* Scale out to match an increased load
* Scale in to match a decreased load
* Ensure we have minimum and maximum number of machines running
* Automatically register new instances to a load balancer

ASG - Scaling Strategy
* Manual Scaling: Update the size of an ASG manually
* Dynamic Scaling: 
a. Simple/step scaling
   when a cloud watch alarm is triggered(example CPU > 70%), then add 2 units
   when a cloud watch alarm is triggered(example CPU < 30%), then remove 1 units
b. Target Tracking scaling
   Example: I want the average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%
c. Scheduled Scaling
   Increase the min capacity to 10 at 5 pm on Fridays
d. Predictive Scaling
   Uses a Machine learning to predict the traffic ahead of time
