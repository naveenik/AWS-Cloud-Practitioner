Attack protection

------- Route 53 ----------

Route 53 is a Managed DNS(Domain Name system)
DNS is a collection of rules and records with helps clients understand how to reach server through URLs

*No Health Checks DNS type
Simple Rouing Policy

*Health Check DNS type
Wieighted Routing Policy
Latency Routing Policy
Failover Routing Policy

Steps to Route the IP address to domain name
1. Buy the domain name in Route 53 with cost 12 per year
2. Create a records in that domain by adding IP address, which will route automatically to doamin purchased

-------- AWS CloudFront --------

* Content Delivery Network
* Improves Read Performance, content is cached at the Edge
* Improves user Experience

CloudFront - Origins
S3 Bucket
Custom Origin 

CloudFront v|s S3 Cross Region Replication 

CloudFront:
Global Edge Network
Files are cached for a TTL
Great for static content that must avaialble everywhere

S3 Cross Region Replication:
Must be setup each region you want to replication to happen
Files are updated in near real-time
Great for Dynamic content that needs to be avaialble at low-latency in few regions

--------- S3 Transfer Accerlation -----------

Accelerate global Uploads and downloads into Amazon S3
Increase Transfer speed by transfering file to an AWS edge location which will forward
the data to S3 bucket in the target region

-------- AWS Global Accelerator -------

Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network
It will connect the Edge location, request from region, then it connect the Aplication region
with minimal latency response

AWS Global Accelerator v|s CloudFront

They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
Both services integrate with AWS Shield for Ddos Protection

* CloudFront - Content Delivery Network
Improves the performance for your cacheable contect(images and videos)
content is served at edge

* Gloabl Accelerator
No caching, proxing packets at the edge of the applications running in one or more AWS regions
Improves a performance for wide range of applications over TCP or UDP

--------- AWS Outposts ---------

They are the server racks that offers the same AWS Infrastructure, services, API and tools to build 
your own applicaitons on-premises just as in the cloud.
***
we are responsible for Physical security
Benefits:
Low latency access to on-premises systems
local data processing
Data residency, Easier migration of data from on-premises to cloud
Fully managed service
* Some service that works on Outposts
EC2, EBS, S3, EKS, ECS, RDS, EMR etc

------- AWS Wavelength --------

Wavelength Zones are infrastructure deployments embedded within the telecommunications providers, datacentres at the edge of the 5G networks
***
Ultra low-latecny applications through 5G networks

Ultra-low latency applications 

2. -------- Cloud Integrations -----------

When we start deploying multiple applications, they will inevitably need to communicate with one another

a. Synchronous comminication                b. Asynchronous communication
Buying service ------> Shipping service       Buying service ---> Queue ---> Shipping service

Synchronous between applications can be problematic if there is a sudden spike
In this case its better to decouple the applications
* using SQS: Queue Model
* using SNS: pub/sub Model
* using Kinesis: real-time data streaming model
These services scale independently from our applications

-------- SQS Service ---------

Fully managed service(~Serverless), use to decouple applications
Scale from 1 message per secount to 10000s per secound
Default retentition of messges: 4 days, maximum 14 days
Messages are deleted after they are read by consumers
Consumers share the work to read messages and scale Horizontally
  
                     WEB Servers                           VIDEO Processing
                        
(users)request --> EC2 Instance(ASG)  ---> SQS Queue  ---> EC2 Instance(ASG)

-------- SNS Service ----------

when we want to send one message to many recievers, we use SNS service.

The event publishers only sends messages to one SNS topic
As many event subscribers as we went to listen to the SNS topic notofications

SNS subscriptions can be:
HTTP/HTTPS
Emails, SMS messages, Mobile notifications
SQS Queue, Lambda functions

-------- Amazon Kinesis ---------
Kinesis - Real-time Big data streaming
Managed service to collect, process, and anlayze real-time streaming data at any scale

Kinesis Data streams: Low latency streaming to ingest data at scale from hundreds of thousands of sources
Kineses Data Firehouse: Load streams into S3, Redshift, Elastic-search etc
Kinesis Data Analystics: perform real-time analytics on streams using SQL
Kinesis Video Streams: Monitor real-time video streams for analytics or ML

-------- Amazon MQ ----------

Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ.
SQS, SNS are cloud native services and they are using proprietary protocols from AWS.
Traditional applications running from on-premises may use open protocols such as
MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS

When migrating to the cloud, instead of re-enginnering the application to use SQS and SNS, we use Amazon MQ
Amazon MQ = Managed Apache ActiveMQ
Amazon MQ doesn't scale as much as SQS/SNS
Amazon MQ runs on dedicated machine(not serverless)
Amazon MQ has both queue feature SQS and topic feature SNS 

-------- Summary ---------

SQS:
Queue service in AWS
Mutiple producers, messges are kept upto 14 days
Mutiple Consumers share the read and delete messages when done
Used to Decouple applications in AWS

SNS:
Notification service in AWS
Subscribers Email, Lambda, SQS, HTTP, Mobile
Multiple subscribers, sends all message to them all
No message retention

Kinesis: Real-time data streaming , persistance and analytics

Amazon MQ: Managed Apache MQ in the cloud(MQTT, AMQP protocols)
(for both ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ)

3. -------- Cloud Monitoring -----------

CloudWatch Provides metrics for every services in AWS
Important Metric:
EC2 Instance: CPU Utilization, status check, Network
EBS Volumes: Disk Read/Writes
S3 Buckets: BucketSizeBytes, NumberofObjects, AllRequests
Billing: Total Estiamted Charge
Service Limits: How much you have been using a service API
Custom Metrics: Push your own metrcs

CloudWatch Alarms
Alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric
Alarm actions:
* Auto scaling: Increase or decrease EC2 Instance desired count
* EC2 Actions: Stop or Terminate, reboot, an EC2 Instance
* SNS notifications: send a notification into an SNS topic
various Options (sampling, %, Min, Max)

Example: create a billing Alarm on the CloudWatch Billing Metric
Alarm States: OK, INSUFFICIENT_DATA, Alarm

------ CloudWatch Logs --------------
It can collect logs from:
Elastic Beanstalk: collection of logs from application
ECS: collection from containers
AWS Lambda: collction from function logs
CloudTrail based on filter
CloudWatch log agents: on EC2 machines or on-premises servers
Route 53: Log DNS Queries

Enable real-time monitoring of logs
Adjustable Cloudwatch Logs Retention

-------- Amazon CloudWatch Events(Event Bridge) --------
Delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describes changes in AWS resources

It used to Schedule: Cron Jobs
Event Pattern
Trigger lambda Function, Send SQS/SNS messages

Event Bridge is the next Evolution of CLoudWatch Events
Default Event Bus, Partner event bus, custom Event buses and Schema Registry

-------- AWS CloudTrail --------
Provides governance, compliance and audit for your aws account
It get an History of Events/API calls made within your AWS account by,
Console, SDK, CLI, AWS services
***
If a resource is deleted in AWS, investigate CloudTrail first.

CloudTrial Events Types:
* Management Events
  Operations that are performed on resources in AWS account
  Ex- Configuring Security, configuring rules for routing data
  
* Data Events
  By default, data events are not logged
  S3  Object-level activity(GetObject, DeleteOject, PutObject)
  
* CloudTrial Insights Events

4. -------- VPC and Networking ----------

VPC(Regional resource):               Private Network to deploy your resources
Subnets(Availability Azone resource): Allow you to partition your network inside your VPC.
Public Subnet: 						  Subnet that is accessible from the Internet
Private Subnet:                       Subnet that is not accessible from the Internet
Route Tables:                         To Define access to Internet and between subnets

Internet Gateway and NAT Gateways:
Internet Gateways: It helps your VPC instances connect with the Internet
Public Subnets have a route to the InternetGateway
                              
Public Subnet  === EC2 instance ----> IGW(Routing to IGW using Route Tables)  ---> Exposed to Internet
Private Subnet === Database ----> NAT(Here DB is routed to NAT from there routed to IGW)  ---> Exposed to Internet

NAT Gateways(AWS-managed) and NAT Instances(self-managed) allow your instances in your Private subnets
to access the internet while remaining in Private.

NACL(Network Acess Control List):
* A firewall which controls traffic from and to subnet
* Can Have Allow and Deny Rules
* Are Attached at the subnet level
* Rules only Include IP address

Security Groups:
* A firewall that controls traffic to and from an EC2 Instance
* Can have only Allow rules
* Rules includes IP address and other security Groups

EC2 Instance(Security Group)  ---> NACL ---> Public Subnet

Security Group                                 Netwrok ACL
* Operates at Instance Level                  Operates at Subnet level
* Support Allow Rules only                    Support Allow rules and Deny rules
* Is Stateful: Return traffic is              Is Stateless: Return Traffic must be Explicitly
automatic allowed, regardless of any rules    allowed by rules

VPC Flow logs:
Capture Information about IP traffic going into your interfaces
VPC flow logs, Subnet Flow logs, Elastic Netwrok Interface flow logs 
Helps us to monitor and troubleshoot connectivity issues,
VPC Flow logs data can go to S3/CloudWatch Logs

VPC Peering:
* Connect two VPC, privately using AWS's Network
* Make them behave as if they were in the same network
* Must not have Overlapping CIDR(IP address range)
VPC Peering connection is not transitive(must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one Another)

VPC Endpoints:
It allows you to connect securely to your VPC to another service
This gives you Enhanced security and lower latency to access AWS services
VPC Endpoint Gateway: for S3 and DynamoDB
VPC Endpoint Interface: The rest AWS services

Site to Site VPN:
* Connect an On-premises VPN to AWS
* Goes Over the Public netwrok and little slow

Direct Connect(DX):
* Establish a Physical connection between on-premises and AWS
* The connection is private network, secure and fast
***
How to make connection
On-premises: must use a Customer Gateway:(CGW)
AWS: must use a Virtual Private Gateway:(VGW)
Once this Gateways are established are connected through Site-to-Site Connection

Transit Gateway:
For having transitive peering between thousands of VPC and On-premises, hub-and-spoke connection
One signle Gateway to provide this functionality.

--------- Summary ------------
VPC: Virtual Private Cloud
Subnets: Tied to an AZ, network partition of the VPC
Internet Gateway: at the VPC level for public subnets, provide internet access
NAT Gateway/Instances: Give Internet access to Priavte Subnets
